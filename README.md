# Color-Game
This is a fun color game.There is an easy and hard mode to the game, where easy allows you to guess between only three blocks while hard allows you to guess between six blocks.  This project was made with the help of Colt Steele and his Udemy Class "The Web Developer Bootcamp" (url: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).
